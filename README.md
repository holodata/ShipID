# ShipID

> A fully-automated YouTube membership verification & role-assignment bot for Discord

> Under development stage. Join our Discord server for participating in dev process.

**ShipID** is inspired by [Gentei](https://github.com/member-gentei/member-gentei) project.
As a way to verify a user's membership, we are relying on the vast amount of live chat collected by our [Honeybee](https://github.com/holodata/honeybee), and video comments as a backup strategy.
