# ShipID

A Discord bot provides automated YouTube membership verification and role assignment services on your server.

> Under development stage. Join our Discord server for the further info.

**ShipID** is inspired by [Gentei](https://github.com/member-gentei/member-gentei) project. As a way to verify a user's membership, we are relying on the vast amount of live chat collected by our [Honeybee](https://github.com/holodata/honeybee) cluster. Therefore, minimal permissions are sufficient to check a user's YouTube account (we only ask for `youtube.read` scope).
